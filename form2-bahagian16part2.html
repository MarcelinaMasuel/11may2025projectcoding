"Did I not try hard enough during training? I pushed myself until my vision started to blur, everything went dark, and my hearing felt like it was blocked. I ALMOST F*CKING FAINTED DURING TRAINING. But all I got in return was disappointment," I said to myself. My heart hurt so badly at that moment. Then korang PBSM keluar. You called my name, and I turned my head towards you for a second before quickly looking away, assuming you didn’t see my eyes. But from the corner of my eye, I saw you walking toward me. You sat down beside me, trying to comfort me. You know, you were the third person to ever comfort me after my mom and Grecia. But honestly, no one has comforted me like you did. When you said, "Aw, it's okay," ARGGHH, MY TEARS FLOWED EVEN HARDER! Like seriously, you were the first person who ever let me cry on their shoulder. I really wanted you to stay with me longer that day. But I didn’t want you to go home late because of me, so I forced myself to stand up.
