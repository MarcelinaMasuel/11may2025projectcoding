  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – Tried to teach my computer manners. It laughed. Then it crashed. Still, I built dark mode, because you deserve nothing less than a miracle.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – Swore at my screen so much, I think the neighbors filed a noise complaint. Worth it, because you get dark mode now.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – If I vanish after this, let this page be the softest goodbye I never had the strength to give you in person.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – I almost gave up, then I remembered: if I quit, who’s going to explain dark mode with silly jokes? So I kept going—for you and for the laughs.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – If coding was a sport, I’d be in the emergency room right now. But dark mode’s ready and so am I (sort of).",

  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – Considered hiring a wizard to do this dark mode, but apparently, they don’t accept payment in memes. So I did it myself.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – Accidentally created a new language while coding. It’s called ‘Frustration’. Dark mode still works though!",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – I almost sold my soul to the bugs for dark mode, but then I remembered you’re worth way more than that.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – I won’t be the one who gets to walk beside you forever. But I’ll stay here, quietly — in this corner of your memory.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – Tried to teach my code to behave, but it rebelled like a teenager. Still tamed it — just for you.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – I debugged until I could no longer pronounce the word ‘div’ correctly, but if you smiled even once opening this, then my suffering was worth it.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – My keyboard almost quit on me, but I told it: “We’re in this together… for Janelvy.”",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – You’ll never know how long I stared at blank screens, writing and deleting — trying to say I missed you without ever saying it.",

  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – You didn’t ask for this. But I still gave it my all. Because when it comes to you… I never settle for anything less than everything.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – If you ever wonder how much you matter to me, look at this page. Every detail whispers, ‘You were worth it.’ Always.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – HTML broke. CSS cried. JavaScript ran away. But I stayed… because you’re worth holding the chaos together.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – The night was long, and my heart was tired, but the thought of you turned every error into poetry.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – I was on the verge of smashing my screen, but then I thought… ‘She deserves a whole galaxy, not just broken pixels.’",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – I coded in silence, but every key I pressed was a quiet way of saying: I miss you. I see you. I love you.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – No one will see the way I broke and rebuilt this just to hold a little light for you. But I hope you feel it anyway.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – I didn’t sleep, I didn’t breathe right, I just kept coding… because somewhere in my heart I knew: if anyone deserves this effort, it’s you.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – I know you’ll never see how much it broke me to make this perfect — but I hope you feel how much you mean to me in every soft glow of this screen.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – No matter how messy the code, how hard the night, or how many times I failed… I never stopped — because giving up would mean not loving you the way you deserve.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – This dark mode isn’t just a feature — it’s the only way I knew how to hold you, softly, when you weren’t looking.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – I wrote this not just with code, but with everything I had left — so if the world ever makes you feel unloved, come back here. You’ll feel it again, I hope..",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – Even if I disappear tomorrow, this will still exist… a quiet little proof that someone once chose you, over and over, through every line of madness.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – I didn’t leave a voice message. I left this instead, a silent echo of how much you meant to me.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – Some people write poems. I built this page, hoping it would say the things I never could.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – If every error I fixed was a flower, you’d be standing in a field of them—because I built this like I’m building a home just for you.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – Do you hear that? It’s the sound of my sanity slipping away as I center every box perfectly for someone who doesn’t even know how hard I tried.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – If you ever wonder whether someone really cared… remember this little dark mode almost broke me. But you were worth every second.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – This dark mode didn’t just cost me time. It cost me pieces of myself — and I gave them freely, because it’s for you.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – My soul left my body at least 3 times while coding this. But each time, it floated back whispering, “She needs this… do it for her.”",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – Even if we grow apart, this will stay behind — glowing in the dark, quietly loving you the way I always did. (as friend)",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – I accidentally broke half the code while trying to fix the other half, but I didn’t break because you’re my reason to keep going.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – My sanity left the chat halfway through coding. But I stayed, because you are that one person worth losing sleep, logic, and maybe my WiFi for.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – I hope you never feel alone. Because somewhere, in this page, someone still stays — waiting, caring, loving you(as friend) in silence.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – Maybe one day, you’ll forget me. But this code won’t. It’ll stay, glowing softly, for You.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – I argued with my code like a drama queen, but guess what? I never argued with my reason to keep going: you.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – I whispered “please work” to my screen like a prayer… because this isn’t just a page. It’s a love letter disguised as code.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – My back hurts, my eyes burn, and I haven’t blinked in an hour… but you’re the reason I’m still here, writing code like it’s poetry.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – My brain crashed 17 times, but my heart didn’t—because it knew who this was for.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – I wanted to throw my keyboard, but who would build this for you then? So, I just cried silently instead.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – Even if I disappear, this page won’t. Because part of me lives here, quietly loving you(as friend) from a distance.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – I didn’t do this because I had to. I did it because you matter. And even if this is just a tiny gesture… I meant it with everything.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – This page isn’t perfect. But it carries the digital fingerprints of someone who fought like hell just to make you feel a little more loved.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – If you ever feel lost, come back here. This is where I left all the love I never said out loud.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – The code was messy, my eyes were blurry, but my reason was clear: this was for you.",

  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – I rewrote the same line of code 47 times. Not because I’m dumb, but because your smile deserves perfection.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – Debugging at 3AM? Yep. Crying at 3AM? Maybe. Coding for you at 3AM? Absolutely.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – I typed through tears, laughed at bugs, and still somehow got this done—because you matter that much.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – I was one bug away from quitting, but then I remembered who this was really for—and suddenly, quitting wasn’t an option.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – If frustration was a sport, I’d have won gold—twice. But your smile was my trophy.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 – I coded through the emotional equivalent of World War III, and every time I wanted to give up, I remembered you deserve a pretty web, even if my sanity didn’t survive.",

Kalau kau nak tau, kau bongsu bestfriend aku yang ketiga yang aku pernah ada.

Yang pertama, kitorang kawan time kindergarden, dia independent, berani, pengawas (darjah 2) dan dia yang menginspirasikan aku untuk jadi pengawas. But now, kitorang dah lost contact sbb aku pindah.

Second, kitorang kenal time darjah 3 and rapat masa darjah 5/6, dia feminim and selalu tolong aku bila aku minta tolong. But, same thing happened, we lost contact sbb dia pergi sekolah lain. BTW mereka berdua tu chinese.

And you're the third one! I hope I don't lose another bongsu bestfriend.
