  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì HTML broke. CSS cried. JavaScript ran away. But I stayed‚Ä¶ because you‚Äôre worth holding the chaos together.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì The night was long, and my heart was tired, but the thought of you turned every error into poetry.",

  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì No matter how messy the code, how hard the night, or how many times I failed‚Ä¶ I never stopped, because giving up would mean not loving you(as friend) the way you deserve.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì This web is the only way I knew how to hold you, softly, when you weren‚Äôt looking.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì I wrote this not just with code, but with everything I had left ‚Äî so if the world ever makes you feel unloved, come back here. You‚Äôll feel it again.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì Even if I disappear tomorrow, this will still exist‚Ä¶ a quiet little proof that someone once chose you, over and over, through every line of madness.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt leave a voice message. I left this instead, a silent echo of how much you meant to me.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì Some people write poems. I built this page, hoping it would say the things I never could.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì If every error I fixed was a flower, you‚Äôd be standing in a field of them, because I built this like I‚Äôm building a home just for you.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì Do you hear that? It‚Äôs the sound of my sanity slipping away as I center every box perfectly for someone who doesn‚Äôt even know how hard I tried.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì If you ever wonder whether someone really cared‚Ä¶ remember this little dark mode feature almost broke me. But you were worth every second.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì This web and the features I coded didn‚Äôt just cost me time. It cost me pieces of myself, and I gave them freely, because it‚Äôs for you.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì My soul left my body at least 3 times while coding this. But each time, it floated back whispering, ‚ÄúShe needs this‚Ä¶ do it for her.‚Äù",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì Even if we grow apart, this will stay behind, glowing in the dark, quietly loving you(as friend) the way I always did.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì I accidentally broke half the code while trying to fix the other half, but I didn‚Äôt break because you‚Äôre my reason to keep going.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì My sanity left the chat halfway through coding. But I stayed, because you are that one person worth losing sleep, logic, and maybe my WiFi for.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì I hope you never feel alone. Because somewhere, in this page, someone still stays, waiting, caring, loving you(as friend) in silence.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì Maybe one day, you‚Äôll forget me. But this code won‚Äôt. It‚Äôll stay, glowing softly, for You.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì I argued with my code like a drama queen, but guess what? I never argued with my reason to keep going: You.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì I whispered ‚Äúplease work‚Äù to my screen like a prayer‚Ä¶ because this isn‚Äôt just a page. It‚Äôs a love letter disguised as code.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì My back hurts, my eyes burn, and I haven‚Äôt blinked in an hour‚Ä¶ but you‚Äôre the reason I‚Äôm still here, writing code like it‚Äôs poetry.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì My brain crashed 17 times, but my heart didn‚Äôt, because it knew who this was for.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì I wanted to throw my keyboard, but who would build this for you then? So, I just cried silently instead.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì Even if I disappear, this page won‚Äôt. Because part of me lives here, quietly loving you(as friend) from a distance.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt do this because I had to. I did it because you matter. And even if this is just a tiny gesture‚Ä¶ I meant it with everything.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì This page isn‚Äôt perfect. But it carries the digital fingerprints of someone who fought like hell just to make you feel a little more loved.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì If you ever feel lost, come back here. This is where I left all the love I never said out loud.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì The code was messy, my eyes were blurry, but my reason was clear: this was for You.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì I don‚Äôt always understand coding, but I do understand one thing: you‚Äôre worth every broken line, every crash, every second.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì I wrote this knowing I might never get to say these things to your face.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì I typed lines of code and tears in equal amounts ‚Äî because You‚Äôre the only reason it all makes sense.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì I tried to give up more times than I can count, but then I remembered You‚Äôre the reason I keep hitting ‚ÄòRun‚Äô.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì I rewrote the same line of code 47 times. Not because I‚Äôm dumb, but because Janelvy's smile deserves perfection.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì Debugging at 3AM? Yep. Crying at 3AM? Maybe. Coding for You at 3AM? Absolutely.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì I typed through tears, laughed at bugs, and still somehow got this done, because you matter that much.",
  "Last Updated on 9 June 2025 ‚Äì I was one bug away from quitting, but then I remembered who this was really for‚Äîand suddenly, quitting wasn‚Äôt an option.",

Kalau kau nak tau, kau bongsu bestfriend aku yang ketiga yang aku pernah ada.

Yang pertama, kitorang kawan time kindergarden, dia independent, berani, pengawas (darjah 2) dan dia yang menginspirasikan aku untuk jadi pengawas. But now, kitorang dah lost contact sbb aku pindah.

Second, kitorang kenal time darjah 3 and rapat masa darjah 5/6, dia feminim and selalu tolong aku bila aku minta tolong. But, same thing happened, we lost contact sbb dia pergi sekolah lain. BTW mereka berdua tu chinese.

And you're the third one! I hope I don't lose another bongsu bestfriend.
