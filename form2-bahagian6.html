  "There‚Äôs no grand reason this page exists ‚Äî just a quiet one: I care, and I wanted you to feel it.",
  "Made this web, happen despite bugs, tears, and one near laptop disaster, all because of you.",
  "I moved slowly, messed up a lot, but never stopped ‚Äî because this wasn‚Äôt just about getting it done. It was about showing someone they‚Äôre worth the effort.",
  "236+ breakdowns, 100+ Stack Overflow tabs‚Ä¶ all to make sure someone feels just a little more loved today.",
  "Had a full conversation with my code (it‚Äôs ignoring me), but for You, I‚Äôm still best friends with the bugs.",
  "It wasn't just code. Every bracket, every bug, every fix ‚Äî it was a way of saying ‚Äúyou matter to me‚Äù without needing any loud words.",
  "Screamed at the screen in silence, but for you, I‚Äôm smiling through the pain.",
  "Thought about giving up, then remembered who this was for, and I told myself, ‚ÄúNo way I‚Äôm letting Pipi see an ugly webpage. Not on my watch.‚Äù",
  "Nearly called tech support to fix my broken soul, but then I remembered: Janelvy deserves this web, no matter what.",
  "They say real friends won‚Äôt suffer in silence. I suffered loudly. In code. For you.",
  "Some nights, I was so tired I stared at the screen for hours. But I stayed ‚Äî because in a world where everything feels temporary, I wanted this to feel like something that would stay. For you.",
  "Almost lost my mind debugging, but then I thought: if Pipi can handle my craziness, I can handle this code.",
  "Cried a little, laughed a lot, and still managed to code this web,for the one and only you who‚Äôs worth every bug and meltdown.",
  "Almost threw my laptop out the window, but then I remembered you might want to see it work‚Ä¶ so I just yelled at it instead.",
  "Had a full-on argument with my code. I lost. But I kept going‚Ä¶ because, well, that‚Äôs what you get when you care this much.",
  "No one saw me crying in silence while fixing the colors‚Ä¶ but I kept going, because I knew you‚Äôd see it one day.",
  "My brain almost melted, my patience ran out‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm stubborn and you‚Äôre worth every meltdown.",

  "Thought about quitting, but then I remembered you‚Äôd probably tease me for giving up. So here‚Äôs the web, take it!",
  "Talked to my code like it was a rebellious teenager. It still won‚Äôt listen. But the web is here, so mission kinda accomplished.",
  "Tried to teach my computer manners. It laughed. Then it crashed. Still, I built this web, because you deserve nothing less than a miracle.",
  "Swore at my screen so much, I think the neighbors filed a noise complaint. Worth it, because you get to see this web now.",
  "All I wanted was to make something that told you: You matter. You‚Äôre remembered. You‚Äôre not just background in someone else‚Äôs story ‚Äî you‚Äôre the reason this page even exists.",

  "Had a full-on argument with my keyboard. It‚Äôs still not talking to me, but the web is finally done.",
  "This code broke me. But so did the thought of Pipi not seeing this. So I picked myself up, restarted my brain, and kept going.",
  "Cried a little, laughed a lot, and somehow made dark mode happen. All for you, you beautiful nightmare.",
  "I almost threw my laptop out the window, but then I imagined Pipi's face if this page actually worked ‚Äî so I stayed, and coded, and cried (a bit).",
  "Accidentally created a new language while coding. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄòFrustration‚Äô. This web still works though!",
  "I almost sold my soul to the bugs for this web, but then I remembered you‚Äôre worth way more than that.",
  "I didn't know what I was doing half the time. But I knew who I was doing it for ‚Äî and that was enough to keep my fingers moving.",

  "I googled, I failed, I restarted. But the only constant was this: it‚Äôs for Pipi. And for her, even HTML errors feel worth it.",
  "Tried to teach my code to behave, but it rebelled like a teenager. Still tamed it, just for you.",
  "I debugged until I could no longer pronounce the word ‚Äòdiv‚Äô correctly, but if you smiled even once opening this, then my suffering was worth it.",
  "My keyboard almost quit on me, but I told it: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in this together‚Ä¶ for Janelvy.‚Äù",

  "If my code was a person, it‚Äôd be in therapy by now, but I survived for you!",
  "Maybe it‚Äôs not much. But it‚Äôs real. And it‚Äôs one of the truest things I‚Äôve ever made ‚Äî just so you‚Äôd know how much you mean to me.",
  "I stared at the screen for 6 hours straight, contemplating life, identity, and semicolons‚Ä¶ all because I wanted you to open this and feel seen.",
  "My code threw tantrums, I threw jokes back. Still here, making this web sparkle just for you.",
  "You didn‚Äôt ask for this. But I still gave it my all. Because when it comes to you‚Ä¶ I never settle for anything less than everything.",
  "If you ever wonder how much you matter to me, look at this page. Every detail whispers, ‚ÄòYou were worth it.‚Äô Always.",
  "HTML broke. CSS cried. JavaScript ran away. But I stayed‚Ä¶ because you‚Äôre worth holding the chaos together.",
  "The night was long, and my heart was tired, but the thought of you turned every error into poetry.",
  "I was on the verge of smashing my screen, but then I thought‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòPipi deserves a whole galaxy, not just broken pixels.‚Äô",
  "I coded in silence, but every key I pressed was a quiet way of saying: I miss you. I see you. I love you(as friend).",
  "No one will see the way I broke and rebuilt this just to hold a little light for you. But I hope you feel it anyway.",
  "I didn‚Äôt sleep, I didn‚Äôt breathe right, I just kept coding‚Ä¶ because somewhere in my heart I knew: if anyone deserves this effort, it‚Äôs you.",
  "I know you‚Äôll never see how much it broke me to make this perfect ‚Äî but I hope you feel how much you mean to me in every soft glow of this screen.",
  "No matter how messy the code, how hard the night, or how many times I failed‚Ä¶ I never stopped, because giving up would mean not loving you(as friend) the way you deserve.",
  "This web is the only way I knew how to hold you, softly, when you weren‚Äôt looking.",
  "I wrote this not just with code, but with everything I had left ‚Äî so if the world ever makes you feel unloved, come back here. You‚Äôll feel it again.",
  "Even if I disappear tomorrow, this will still exist‚Ä¶ a quiet little proof that someone once chose you, over and over, through every line of madness.",
  "I didn‚Äôt leave a voice message. I left this instead, a silent echo of how much you meant to me.",
  "Some people write poems. I built this page, hoping it would say the things I never could.",
  "If every error I fixed was a flower, you‚Äôd be standing in a field of them, because I built this like I‚Äôm building a home just for you.",
  "Do you hear that? It‚Äôs the sound of my sanity slipping away as I center every box perfectly for someone who doesn‚Äôt even know how hard I tried.",
  "If you ever wonder whether someone really cared‚Ä¶ remember this little dark mode feature almost broke me. But you were worth every second.",
  "This web and the features I coded didn‚Äôt just cost me time. It cost me pieces of myself, and I gave them freely, because it‚Äôs for you.",
  "My soul left my body at least 3 times while coding this. But each time, it floated back whispering, ‚ÄúShe needs this‚Ä¶ do it for her.‚Äù",
  "Even if we grow apart, this will stay behind, glowing in the dark, quietly loving you(as friend) the way I always did.",
  "I accidentally broke half the code while trying to fix the other half, but I didn‚Äôt break because you‚Äôre my reason to keep going.",
  "My sanity left the chat halfway through coding. But I stayed, because you are that one person worth losing sleep, logic, and maybe my WiFi for.",
  "I hope you never feel alone. Because somewhere, in this page, someone still stays, waiting, caring, loving you(as friend) in silence.",
  "Maybe one day, you‚Äôll forget me. But this code won‚Äôt. It‚Äôll stay, glowing softly, for You.",
  "I argued with my code like a drama queen, but guess what? I never argued with my reason to keep going: You.",
  "You‚Äôll never see the full story of how hard I tried. And you don‚Äôt have to. Just know this: I did it because you matter to me. So much.",
  "I whispered ‚Äúplease work‚Äù to my screen like a prayer‚Ä¶ because this isn‚Äôt just a page. It‚Äôs a love letter disguised as code.",
  "My back hurts, my eyes burn, and I haven‚Äôt blinked in an hour‚Ä¶ but you‚Äôre the reason I‚Äôm still here, writing code like it‚Äôs poetry.",
  "My brain crashed 17 times, but my heart didn‚Äôt, because it knew who this was for.",
  "I wanted to throw my keyboard, but who would build this for you then? So, I just cried silently instead.",
  "Even if I disappear, this page won‚Äôt. Because part of me lives here, quietly loving you(as friend) from a distance.",
  "I didn‚Äôt do this because I had to. I did it because you matter. And even if this is just a tiny gesture‚Ä¶ I meant it with everything.",
  "This page isn‚Äôt perfect. But it carries the digital fingerprints of someone who fought like hell just to make you feel a little more loved.",
  "If you ever feel lost, come back here. This is where I left all the love I never said out loud.",
  "The code was messy, my eyes were blurry, but my reason was clear: this was for You.",
  "Even when I didn‚Äôt know how, I still wanted to give you something that says, ‚ÄúHey, you matter. More than you know.‚Äù",
  "I don‚Äôt always understand coding, but I do understand one thing: you‚Äôre worth every broken line, every crash, every second.",
  "I wrote this knowing I might never get to say these things to your face.",
  "Somewhere between all the errors and tired nights, I realised: I‚Äôd do this again. Just to make you feel a little more seen.",
  "I typed lines of code and tears in equal amounts ‚Äî because You‚Äôre the only reason it all makes sense.",
  "I didn‚Äôt just build this for fun ‚Äî I built this so you‚Äôd never have to wonder if someone out there really, truly cares about you.",
  "I tried to give up more times than I can count, but then I remembered You‚Äôre the reason I keep hitting ‚ÄòRun‚Äô.",
  "I rewrote the same line of code 47 times. Not because I‚Äôm dumb, but because Janelvy's smile deserves perfection.",
  "I didn‚Äôt write this for the world. I wrote it so you‚Äôd never forget how much you mattered to someone ‚Äî even when you weren‚Äôt asking to.",
  "Debugging at 3AM? Yep. Crying at 3AM? Maybe. Coding for You at 3AM? Absolutely.",
  "You were the reason behind every retry, every fix, every late night ‚Äî even if you never asked for any of it.",
  "I typed through tears, laughed at bugs, and still somehow got this done, because you matter that much.",
  "I was one bug away from quitting, but then I remembered who this was really for‚Äîand suddenly, quitting wasn‚Äôt an option.",
  "If coding was a sport, I‚Äôd have won gold‚Äîtwice. But your smile was my trophy.",
  "I kept fixing things not because I‚Äôm patient ‚Äî but because someone made me believe this effort could turn into comfort for them.",
  "I coded through the emotional equivalent of World War III, and every time I wanted to give up, I remembered You deserve a pretty web, even if my sanity didn‚Äôt survive.",
  "If this ever fades‚Ä¶ if everything disappears one day‚Ä¶ just remember: I built something just to remind you that you‚Äôre not invisible.",
  "Sometimes love isn‚Äôt loud. Sometimes it looks like someone quietly building something you‚Äôll never see the full struggle behind ‚Äî just so you smile.",
  "I Googled ‚Äúhow to not lose my mind‚Äù but ended up Googling ‚Äúhow to make Janelvy smile‚Äù instead.",
  "Some people wait their whole lives to feel safe and loved. If this page can give you even 1% of that ‚Äî then it‚Äôs already enough for me.",
  "I didn‚Äôt want credit. I just wanted you to feel like you were never forgotten.",
  "This is not just a page ‚Äî it‚Äôs every version of me that stayed up, just to make sure you never felt unloved.",
  "Some people write poems. I wrote this ‚Äî in silence, in effort, in love ‚Äî just so you‚Äôd never forget your worth to me",
  "I‚Äôm not the best at saying things‚Ä¶ so I built this for you instead ‚Äî a quiet way to scream, ‚ÄòYou matter to me.‚Äô",
  "You don‚Äôt owe me anything ‚Äî but if you ever wonder why this exists‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs because someone out there still believes you‚Äôre worth every effort, every second, every gentle kind of love",
  "You didn‚Äôt see the late nights, the quiet breakdowns ‚Äî but that‚Äôs okay. I didn‚Äôt do this to be seen. I did it so you‚Äôd never feel unseen.",
  "This is what it looks like when someone chooses you quietly, fiercely, and without needing a single thing in return",
  "I didn‚Äôt write poems. I didn‚Äôt send long texts. But I built something ‚Äî and every line of code was just another way of saying: ‚ÄòPlease be okay.‚Äô",
  "Some people show love through words. I built mine with hours, with effort, with all the things you never saw ‚Äî and all the things I never needed credit for.",
  "I don‚Äôt care if you never see how much this cost me. What matters is that one day, when the world feels too heavy ‚Äî you‚Äôll feel this love still holding you, quietly",
  "If love had no shape, then mine looked like effort. Like late nights, tired eyes, and silent prayers for you to be okay.",
  "If I could only do one thing in this life ‚Äî it would be making sure you never feel unloved again, even after I‚Äôm gone",
  "I didn‚Äôt write this to be remembered. I wrote this in case one day‚Ä¶ you needed proof that someone once loved you more than words could ever say",
  "I never said it out loud, but every little thing I did was just me screaming: ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt ever feel alone. Not while I‚Äôm still breathing.‚Äô",
  "I never said it out loud, but every effort, every sleepless night, every silent tear ‚Äî they all whisper one thing: you mean so much more to me than you‚Äôll ever realise",
  "I didn‚Äôt do this because it was easy. I did this because you were worth every breakdown I didn‚Äôt tell you about.",
  "If effort could speak, it would scream your name ‚Äî because this entire thing was built on the quiet hope that you‚Äôd feel loved.",
  "Behind every word here is a version of me ‚Äî tired, unsure, but still choosing to try‚Ä¶ just because you exist.",
  "I broke a little making this, but it‚Äôs okay. If it ever makes you feel loved, even just once ‚Äî it was worth every crack.",
  "Even if one day we stop talking, this will stay here ‚Äî proof that someone once cared enough to try this hard.",
  "You‚Äôll never really know how many times I whispered to myself, ‚Äòjust hold on a bit longer ‚Äî she deserves to see this finished.",
  "If this page could cry, it would. Because it knows how much of me I gave away just so one person would feel even a little more loved",

      Kau ingat lagi tak mainan pistol aku yang aku terjumpa kat sekolah? Yang warna hijau tu. Aku jumpa pistol tu kat koridor astu aku tendang lah tapi bila aku tengok lebih dekat, nampak macam pistol, then aku ambik. I know it's not that important but just want to tell you :).

      walaupun orang lain cakap tu pistol but whatever. Then kau ada cakap 'kau ni macam budak¬≤ lah'. It's been a long time since someone said that to me.

      Then my favourite part, time balik kau tanya aku 'mana pistol kau tu?' then aku kasih tunjuk pistol aku. For a moment, I goes silent thinking about the sentence you just said to me. It feels like you're my mom and I'm your child. Bukan apa, sejak aku pindah Sarawak, iaitu 2020, takde siapa pernah tanya pasal mainan aku. Mereka tanya pasal buku aku, alatan tulis aku, botol aku, cermin mata aku, benda bukan mainan lah. You're the first person who said that to me after 5 years.
