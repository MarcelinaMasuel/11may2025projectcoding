Debugged my soul, sacrificed my sleep… but it’s for you, so of course I did it.
Was I crying over CSS at 2AM? Maybe. But did I finish it for you? Absolutely.
This web nearly broke me. But you're the reason I didn’t quit.
This isn’t about making something perfect. It’s about making sure Janelvy feel seen, appreciated, and never forgotten.
Debugged my code and my sanity, lost sleep and maybe a few brain cells… but, it’s for you, so totally worth it
Nearly threw my laptop out the window while coding, but then I remembered it’s for you, so I gently closed it and kept going.
Battled bugs and my own frustration… but, you deserved the best dark mode I could code (with tears included).
Stayed up late debugging… also questioning life choices(joke) but all worth it because it’s for You.
I don’t know if I’ve ever said it the right way — but everything here is my way of telling you: you’re one of the best parts of my life, Pipi.
There were so many moments I could’ve stopped, but the thought of you seeing this, even once, made me keep going — and that meant everything.
My brain said “give up.” My heart said “she deserves this.” My laptop said “why are we suffering.”
Brain: “Please let me rest.” Heart: “Not yet. There’s someone who needs to feel special tonight.”
I’m not always good with words, but I swear... if effort could speak, this whole page would quietly scream, “you’re loved, more than you realise.”
I could’ve left this halfway… but then I remembered how good it feels to make you feel seen. So I stayed.
You have no idea how many times I wanted to give up — and how many times the thought of your smile when you open this page stopped me.
There’s no grand reason this page exists — just a quiet one: I care, and I wanted you to feel it.
Made this web, happen despite bugs, tears, and one near laptop disaster, all because of you.
I moved slowly, messed up a lot, but never stopped — because this wasn’t just about getting it done. It was about showing someone they’re worth the effort.
236+ breakdowns, 100+ Stack Overflow tabs… all to make sure someone feels just a little more loved today.
Had a full conversation with my code (it’s ignoring me), but for You, I’m still best friends with the bugs.
It wasn't just code. Every bracket, every bug, every fix — it was a way of saying “you matter to me” without needing any loud words.
Screamed at the screen in silence, but for you, I’m smiling through the pain.
Thought about giving up, then remembered who this was for, and I told myself, “No way I’m letting Pipi see an ugly webpage. Not on my watch.”
Nearly called tech support to fix my broken soul, but then I remembered: Janelvy deserves this web, no matter what.
They say real friends won’t suffer in silence. I suffered loudly. In code. For you.
Some nights, I was so tired I stared at the screen for hours. But I stayed — because in a world where everything feels temporary, I wanted this to feel like something that would stay. For you.
Almost lost my mind debugging, but then I thought: if Pipi can handle my craziness, I can handle this code.
Cried a little, laughed a lot, and still managed to code this web,for the one and only you who’s worth every bug and meltdown.
Almost threw my laptop out the window, but then I remembered you might want to see it work… so I just yelled at it instead.
Had a full-on argument with my code. I lost. But I kept going… because, well, that’s what you get when you care this much.
No one saw me crying in silence while fixing the colors… but I kept going, because I knew you’d see it one day.
My brain almost melted, my patience ran out… but I’m stubborn and you’re worth every meltdown.
My tears are in this CSS. My sanity is missing. But if you felt even a little loved opening this page, it was all worth it.💗
Thought about quitting, but then I remembered you’d probably tease me for giving up. So here’s the web, take it!
Talked to my code like it was a rebellious teenager. It still won’t listen. But the web is here, so mission kinda accomplished.
Tried to teach my computer manners. It laughed. Then it crashed. Still, I built this web, because you deserve nothing less than a miracle.
Swore at my screen so much, I think the neighbors filed a noise complaint. Worth it, because you get to see this web now.
All I wanted was to make something that told you: You matter. You’re remembered. You’re not just background in someone else’s story — you’re the reason this page even exists.
If I vanish after this, let this page be the softest goodbye I never had the strength to give you in person.
Sleep? Social life? Sanity? All sacrificed because this is for Pipi, and she deserves a page coded with heart (and 143+ bugs that I fixed at 3AM)
I stared at my screen so long I’m pretty sure it blinked first. Dark mode’s done. You’re welcome (I’m still alive).
Had a full-on argument with my keyboard. It’s still not talking to me, but the web is finally done.
This code broke me. But so did the thought of Pipi not seeing this. So I picked myself up, restarted my brain, and kept going.
Cried a little, laughed a lot, and somehow made dark mode happen. All for you, you beautiful nightmare.
I almost threw my laptop out the window, but then I imagined Pipi's face if this page actually worked — so I stayed, and coded, and cried (a bit).
Accidentally created a new language while coding. It’s called ‘Frustration’. This web still works though!
I almost sold my soul to the bugs for this web, but then I remembered you’re worth way more than that.
I didn't know what I was doing half the time. But I knew who I was doing it for — and that was enough to keep my fingers moving.
I won’t be the one who gets to walk beside you forever. But I’ll stay here, quietly, in this corner of your memory.
I googled, I failed, I restarted. But the only constant was this: it’s for Pipi. And for her, even HTML errors feel worth it.
Tried to teach my code to behave, but it rebelled like a teenager. Still tamed it, just for you.
I debugged until I could no longer pronounce the word ‘div’ correctly, but if you smiled even once opening this, then my suffering was worth it.
My keyboard almost quit on me, but I told it: “We’re in this together… for Janelvy.”
You’ll never know how long I stared at blank screens, writing and deleting, trying to say I missed you without ever saying it.
If my code was a person, it’d be in therapy by now, but I survived for you!
Maybe it’s not much. But it’s real. And it’s one of the truest things I’ve ever made — just so you’d know how much you mean to me.
I stared at the screen for 6 hours straight, contemplating life, identity, and semicolons… all because I wanted you to open this and feel seen.
My code threw tantrums, I threw jokes back. Still here, making this web sparkle just for you.
You didn’t ask for this. But I still gave it my all. Because when it comes to you… I never settle for anything less than everything.
If you ever wonder how much you matter to me, look at this page. Every detail whispers, ‘You were worth it.’ Always.
HTML broke. CSS cried. JavaScript ran away. But I stayed… because you’re worth holding the chaos together.
The night was long, and my heart was tired, but the thought of you turned every error into poetry.
I was on the verge of smashing my screen, but then I thought… ‘Pipi deserves a whole galaxy, not just broken pixels.’
I coded in silence, but every key I pressed was a quiet way of saying: I miss you. I see you. I love you(as friend).
